	<p>Sharks are super cool animals.  One interesting fact out sharks is that they do not have bones.  Their bodies are made of cartiledge.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Sharks also have two rows of teeth.  In fact, they continually grow new teeth throughout their entire life.  When a tooth falls out, the one in the back row moves forward to replace it, and a new one grows in the back row.</p>
